## Minimap / Nodes / FarmHud
Blizzard has designed the Minimap element as All-in-One (Terrain texture + Nodes).
It could not be separated. It could not be copied. Minimap and FarmHud can't be displayed at the same time.
*(It's like the Highlander: There can only be one.)*

## Problems and possible workarounds
1. Use of anonymous frames makes correct functioning more difficult. Possible workaround: Disable "Show elements" in FarmHud Options.

## @Authors of Minimap and UI AddOns
I've added a function to register (anonymous) frames that anchored on Minimap.
Please use it to make smooth cooperation between our AddOns possible.
* `FarmHud:RegisterForeignAddOnObject( <frame object>, <addon name>)`
* Or let me known your function i could trigger on show and hide farmhud.
